# Team Project

## 1st Sprint 

1. Form a group with 2 teams. Please state the group formation in the following [shared google doc file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7Tsn_QPZwvmmfWlbyfvKjP8_WpkdwcQmDDJuS7dmWs/edit#gid=0)
2. Each team will study the last semester team's document, design, and code, and summarize a document to recommend design patterns that (1) are used, (2) should be used, and (3) could be used, as part of the ATAM document.
3. Study docker technique and install and run the last semester team's work on local machine (in your submission, please mark whether this is done).

TAs have created a new Docker image with the project code you will be working on with. The image tag is: `cmusvsc/apachecmda:1.1`

TMUX is installed for your convenience.

We also updated the tutorial with step by step instructions of using docker for this project at the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15InmPSNxm3Wjm1GAIh4_ilVy4rPkYBY1dxcbK7BFmQc/edit?usp=sharing)
