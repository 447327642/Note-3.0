# Week 11 Assignment (Part 1)

> Does the following code fragment implement the Factory Method design pattern? Explain why.

```java
public class XMLReaderFactory {
    // This method returns an instance of a class
    // that implements the XMLReader interface.
    // The specific class it creates and returns is
    // based on a system property.
    public static XMLReader createXMLReader();
}

public interface XMLReader {
    public void setContentHandler(ContentHandler handler):
    public void parse(InputStream is);
}
```

> Typically, there is a significant performance penalty for declaring a method synchronized. In general adding the keyword synchronized to a method slows the invocation of the method by a factor of 6. A common programming idiom used to avoid synchronization in the common case is double check locking. Can the double-check locking idiom be used with the singleton pattern to avoid synchronizing every time the static instance method is called? For example, is the following valid? Explain why.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() { }
    static private Singleton instance = null;
    static public Singleton instance() {
        // Double check locking idiom
        // The synchronization is done internally 
        // rather than on the method. This avoids
        // the expense of synchronizing for the
        // common case.
/*12*/  if( instance == null ) {
            synchronized( Singleton.class ) {
                // Second check
                if( instance == null ) {
/*16*/               instance = new Singleton( );
                 }
            }
        }
/*20*/  return instance;
    }
}
```

> Consider the following scenario, please suggest a design pattern and implement it. The outcome should like this:

In Elizabeth's day care center, the teacher helps the kids to build all kinds of toys to develop their creative skills. One of Elizabeth's favorite activities is to make animals with play-dough.

A set of molds is the tool that Elizabeth always uses to create her favorite cool animals.

One mold tool set includes five parts, including the head, body, arm, leg, and tail. Whenever Elizabeth wants to build an animal, she will use one set of each tools to make a head, body , leg, arm, and tail for that animal, and then assembles them with glue to build an animal. There are many types of animal mold tool sets that the kids can choose from.

For example: if Elizabeth wants to make a monkey, then she will pick the set of monkey molds to start.

+ Step 1. Make monkey head.
+ Step 2. Make monkey body.
+ Step 3. Make monkey leg.
+ Step 4. Make monkey arm.
+ Step 5. Make monkey tail.

Once all the five parts are finished, then Elizabeth will glue them all together and decorate it to have a monkey done as a finished product. Most likely, she will give it to her mom as a gift when she picks her (she will not give her the monkey if the monkey is not decorated, since it will not be looking good at all then). When she wants to make a kitten, she follows the same steps with the set of Kitten molds.
